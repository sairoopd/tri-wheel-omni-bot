# tri-wheel-omni-bot
In this project I have designed a Tri-wheel omni directional vectoring robot.
Omni drectional wheels were chosen for improving the maneuverability. 
The degrees of freedom for conventional wheels is limited to two (forward and backward). Whereas omni directional wheels have upto 3 degrees of freedom which makes them the perfect option for robots that need to work in tight spaces like a warehouse for example.

HARDWARE:
1.Arduino Uno
2.H-bridge motor driver 
3.12V geared DC motors (3)
4.triangualr chassis (3D printed)
